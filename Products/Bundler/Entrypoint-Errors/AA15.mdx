title: "Error AA15: InitCode Must Create Sender"
---

The smart account deployment process with `initCode` fails to return a `sender` address. Possible causes:

1. The `initCode` factory isn't creating an account
2. The factory creates an account but doesn't return the deployed `sender` address

## Potential Fixes

1. Verify the factory address in `initCode` (first 20 bytes of initcode)
2. Ensure correct implementation of the `initCode` factory
3. If problems continue, debug the `initCode` factory using [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)

Addressing these issues should resolve the AA15 error and ensure proper creation of the sender address.
