title: "Error AA20: Account Not Deployed"
description: "Resolving issues when the sender account is not deployed"

No `initCode` was specified, but the `sender` address (smart account) isn't deployed.

## Potential Fixes

1. For first-time transactions, include `initCode` in the user operation
2. If the account should already exist, double-check the `sender` address in the user operation

Ensuring the correct deployment status and address of the sender account will resolve the AA20 error.
