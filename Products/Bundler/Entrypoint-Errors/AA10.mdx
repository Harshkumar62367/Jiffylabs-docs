title: "Error AA10: Sender Already Established"

The smart account (sender) has been previously set up. You might be attempting to initialize the account more than once.

## Potential Fix

Eliminate the `initCode` from the user operation:

```typescript
const operationHash = await bundler.submitUserOp({
    // Remove this line
    // initCode: "0xd74a8b63df73223fcc89f604d6738e66719dbc...",
    // Add this line instead
    initCode: "0x",
    // Other user operation details...
})
