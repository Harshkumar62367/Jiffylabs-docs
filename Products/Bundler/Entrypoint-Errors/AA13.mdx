title: "Error AA13: InitCode Execution Failed or Insufficient Gas"
---

<Note>OOG = Out Of Gas</Note>


The EntryPoint couldn't create the smart account using the provided `initCode`. This could be due to:

1. Gas depletion during `initCode` execution
2. `initCode` reverting during account setup

## Potential Fixes

1. Ensure the factory address in `initCode` is accurate (first 20 bytes of `initCode`)
2. Confirm `initCode` correctness
3. Verify if `verificationGasLimit` is sufficient for `initCode` completion
4. For reverts, investigate the `initCode` execution using debugging tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)

By addressing these potential issues, you can resolve the AA13 error and successfully execute the `initCode`.
