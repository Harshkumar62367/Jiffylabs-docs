## What is a Bundler?

ðŸ’¡ A **Bundler** is a crucial component in the smart account infrastructure. It **validates and executes** `UserOperation` transactions on smart contract wallets on behalf of users.

## Key Functions of Bundlers

1. **Acts as an EOA**: Bundlers function like Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) because all transactions on Ethereum must be triggered by an EOA.

2. **Enhances User Experience**: Bundlers save users from creating and remembering private keys of EOAs to trigger smart contract wallet transactions. This preserves the core benefits of having a smart contract wallet.

3. **Optimizes Gas Usage**: Bundlers are excellent for gas savings:
   - Executing each transaction typically costs a fixed overhead of 21,000 gas.
   - Bundled transactions spread this fixed cost over multiple operations, reducing overall gas costs.
   - Modifying storage in the same transaction becomes incrementally cheaper for each additional operation.

4. **Enables Efficient Execution**: While Ethereum executes transactions linearly to avoid state conflicts, `UserOperations` can be executed as a bundle. Bundlers typically include at most one transaction per smart contract wallet address, preventing clashes when modifying state.

5. **Similarity to Block Builders**: Bundlers share similarities with block builders, as both broadcast validated `UserOperation` transactions to public or private mempools.
