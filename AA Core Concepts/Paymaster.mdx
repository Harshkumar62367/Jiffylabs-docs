ðŸ’¡ A **Paymaster** defines the gas abstraction logic for a smart contract wallet. 

## What is Gas Abstraction?

Gas abstraction enables:
- Gas payment in alternative ERC20 tokens
- Gasless transactions (requiring gas sponsorship from a Paymaster)

## Key Features of Paymasters

1. **Modular Design**: ERC-4337 allows a `UserOperation` to choose any Paymaster by specifying its address and input parameters in the `paymasterAndData` field.

2. **Smart Contract Implementation**: A Paymaster is essentially a smart contract implemented by a dApp. It uses custom logic in the `validatePaymasterOp` function, which the Bundler calls to selectively pay gas for UserOperations.

3. **ETH Deposits**: Paymasters must deposit Ethereum on the Entry Point Contract to pay for gas for UserOperations.

4. **Staking Requirement**: In addition to gas deposits, Paymasters must stake ETH on the Entry Point Contract. This stake acts as an anti-spam measure rather than being slashed.

## Paymaster Interface

The Paymaster interface exposes two crucial functions:

### 1. `validatePaymasterOp`

- Defines the logic for gas abstraction
- Ensures sufficient balance (e.g., checking if the wallet has enough ERC20 tokens for gas payment)
- Called before the execution of a UserOperation
- Follows the principle of separating validation from execution

### 2. `postOp`

- Called at the final step of a smart contract wallet function call
- Can revert the function call if the wallet lacks sufficient ERC20 balance to reimburse the Paymaster
- Double-checks gas sufficiency after function execution
- Gas is still deducted even if a function call fails at this step
