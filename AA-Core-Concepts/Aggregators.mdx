ðŸ’¡ Aggregators play a crucial role in handling diverse signature schemes used by different smart contract wallets.

## Why Aggregators are Important

1. **Signature Scheme Diversity**: Different smart contract wallets use various signature schemes.
2. **Efficient Validation**: Aggregating `UserOperations` with the same scheme allows for separate, more efficient validations.
3. **Gas Optimization**: On-chain cryptographic arithmetic can be gas-intensive. Signature schemes supporting aggregation can significantly reduce gas costs during on-chain validation.

## Key Functions of Aggregators

Aggregators primarily use two essential functions:

### 1. `aggregateSignatures`

- **Input**: An array of `UserOperations`
- **Output**: An aggregated signature using a specific scheme
- **Purpose**: Combines multiple signatures into a single, compact representation

### 2. `validateSignatures`

- **Input**: 
  - An array of `UserOperations`
  - The aggregated signatures
- **Purpose**: Verifies the validity of the aggregated signatures against the provided `UserOperations`

## Benefits of Aggregation

1. **Gas Efficiency**: Reduces the overall gas cost for validating multiple transactions
2. **Scalability**: Enables processing of more transactions within the same gas limits
3. **Flexibility**: Accommodates different signature schemes used by various smart contract wallets
